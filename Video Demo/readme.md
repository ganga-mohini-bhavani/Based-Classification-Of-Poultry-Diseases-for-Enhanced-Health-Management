🐔 PoultryDetect: Transfer Learning-Based Classification of Poultry Diseases

This project was developed as part of a SmartBridge-guided AI/ML internship to assist farmers and veterinarians in early poultry disease detection using deep learning.

## 🎯 Objective

- 1️⃣ Build a deep-learning model to classify poultry diseases.
- 2️⃣ Achieve > 90% accuracy on validation data.
- 3️⃣ Provide a scalable solution deployable on web/mobile.

## 🗂️ Dataset & Structure

- Dataset sourced from **Kaggle**: Poultry Disease Classification.
- Preprocessed and structured into `train`, `test`, and `validation` folders.
- Smaller dataset created for faster experimentation.
